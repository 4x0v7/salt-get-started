#### What is SaltStack? {.sidebar}

SaltStack is a revolutionary approach to infrastructure management that
replaces complexity with speed. SaltStack is simple enough to get
running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of
servers, and fast enough to communicate with each system in seconds.
